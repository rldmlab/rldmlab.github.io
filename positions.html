  <div class="personEntry small-text">

    <p>Doing research is a privilege—an opportunity to pursue meaningful questions that speak to our curiosity about how the brain works. With this privilege comes the responsibility to uphold scientific rigor and to grow together within a collaborative and supportive environment. In our lab, we value a culture where people feel comfortable exploring ideas, learning through the process, and sharing the journey with others who are equally curious and committed. Each lab member leads their own project and takes ownership of their work, while also keeping in mind how their efforts contribute to broader questions that connect us as a team. We stay engaged with one another’s work, offer and receive constructive input, and challenge each other in ways that promote growth. We grow as scientists by being open to feedback, generous with our knowledge, and motivated not just by individual success but by collective discovery.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Neural Representations of Cognitive Maps and Structural Relational Knowledge</li>
      <li>Neural Computations Underlying Abstraction and Cross-Task Generalization</li>
      <li>Neural Representations of Others’ Minds During Social Interaction</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Responsibilities</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Design and run behavioral and neuroimaging experiments</li>
      <li>Develop and analyze computational models</li>
      <li>Analyze neuroimaging (fMRI and/or OPM-MEG) data</li>
      <li>Prepare publications and present findings</li>
      <li>Mentor graduate and undergraduate students in the lab</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Preferred Qualifications</h6>
    <p><i>(Please address each in your application)</i>
      <ul>
        <li>Ph.D. in a relevant field (e.g., cognitive neuroscience, psychology, computer science, or a related discipline)</li>
        <li>Programming experience (e.g., Python, MATLAB, or R)</li>
        <li>Experience with neuroimaging, computational modeling, and/or machine learning</li>
        <li>Publication record</li>
        <li>Strong communication skills</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h6>Location & Application</h6>
        <p>This is a 1-year, on-site position in the Department of Psychology at Virginia Tech (Blacksburg, VA), with the possibility of renewal.
          The start date is flexible, but please indicate your preferred start date in your application. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.
          If the position is filled, a notice will be posted here. To apply, please email the following materials to <a href="mailto:seongmin.a.park@gmail.com">seongmin.a.park@gmail.com</a>
          <ul>

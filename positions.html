<h3 class="personToggle">A Postdoctoral Researcher</h3>
<div class="personEntry">
<p>
    
  <p>The <strong>RLDM Lab</strong> is seeking a highly motivated <strong>Postdoctoral Researcher</strong> to join our interdisciplinary team investigating the neural and computational mechanisms of structured learning and flexible cognition.</p>

  <h3>About the Lab</h3>
  <p>Our research combines behavioral experiments, neuroimaging (fMRI, OPM-MEG), and computational modeling to understand how the human brain builds internal models of task structure, transfers knowledge across contexts, and adapts to changing environments. We aim to bridge cognitive neuroscience with machine learning to uncover principles that support human generalization and decision-making.</p>

  <h3>Project Focus</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Curriculum learning and knowledge transfer</li>
    <li>Neural representation of abstract structure and task hierarchies</li>
    <li>Cognitive map formation and structural generalization</li>
    <li>Replay and latent structure inference using fMRI and MEG</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Design and run behavioral and neuroimaging experiments (fMRI, OPM-MEG)</li>
    <li>Develop and analyze computational models (e.g., reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, graph-based representations)</li>
    <li>Preprocess and analyze neuroimaging data</li>
    <li>Write manuscripts and present findings at scientific conferences</li>
    <li>Mentor graduate and undergraduate students</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Required Qualifications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience, Psychology, Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering, or a related field</li>
    <li>Strong programming skills (Python, MATLAB, or similar)</li>
    <li>Experience in neuroimaging, computational modeling, or machine learning</li>
    <li>Demonstrated ability to publish scientific research</li>
    <li>Excellent communication and collaborative skills</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preferred Qualifications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Background in structured cognition, learning, or decision-making</li>
    <li>Familiarity with neuroimaging pipelines (fMRIPrep, MNE, AFNI, or SPM)</li>
    <li>Interest in cognitive theories of transfer and generalization</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Location & Appointment</h3>
  <p>The lab is located in the Department of Psychology at Virginia Tech (Blacksburg, VA). This is a 1-year appointment with the possibility of renewal based on performance and funding. Start date is flexible. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.</p>

  <h3>To Apply</h3>
  <p>Please email the following to <a href="mailto:spk@vt.edu">spk@vt.edu</a>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cover letter outlining research interests and fit for the position</li>
    <li>CV</li>
    <li>Two representative publications</li>
    <li>Contact information for 2–3 references</li>
  </ul>

<p>
    Postdoctoral research engineer<br/> I'm Inès. I recently obtained my PhD in Neuroscience and Plant Biology. My previous research revolved around studying the olfactory perception of the rose scent. I am now shifting my focus to cognitive neuroscience, the field in which I specialized, with a particular interest in its social aspects. I am intrigued by understanding human behavior, including how individuals integrate salient information, interact with their environment, and communicate with one another. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing badminton, singing in a choir, and regularly attending the cinema. <br/>

    Ph.D. student <br/> I am Maxime, and welcome to my profile! I hold a master's degree in Mathematical Engineering, with a specialization in modeling for neuronal and cognitive systems. The depth of the human experience fascinates me, particularly the evolution of behavior and our ability to comprehend the world through abstract generalizations. In addition to my academic pursuits, I find great joy in playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUYc71GeomY&amp;ab_channel=PeterLater" target="_blank">music</a> and savoring sunny days. <br/>

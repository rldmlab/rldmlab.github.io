  <h5 class="personToggle"><p class="thin200">A Postdoctoral Researcher ▼</p></h5>
  <div class="personEntry small-text">
    
    <p><strong>Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab</strong><br> <em>Department of Psychology, Virginia Tech</em></p>
    <p>The <strong>CCN Lab</strong> is seeking a highly motivated <strong>Postdoctoral Researcher</strong> to join our team investigating the neural and computational mechanisms of structured learning and flexible cognition.</p>

    <h6>About the Lab</h6>
    <p>Our research combines behavioral experiments, neuroimaging (fMRI, OPM-MEG), and computational modeling to understand how the human brain builds internal models of task structure, transfers knowledge across contexts, and generalizes to novel problem-solving.</p>

    <h6>Project Focus</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Neural Representations of Cognitive Maps and Structural Relational Knowledge</li>
      <li>Neural Computations Underlying Abstraction and Cross-Task Generalization</li>
      <li>Neural Representations of Others’ Minds During Social Interaction</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Responsibilities</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Design and run behavioral and neuroimaging experiments</li>
      <li>Develop and analyze computational models</li>
      <li>Analyze neuroimaging (fMRI and/or OPM-MEG) data</li>
      <li>Prepare publications and present findings</li>
      <li>Mentor graduate and undergraduate students in the lab</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Preferred Qualifications</h6>
    <p><i>(Please address each in your application)</i>
      <ul>
        <li>Ph.D. in a relevant field (e.g., cognitive neuroscience, psychology, computer science, or a related discipline)</li>
        <li>Programming experience (e.g., Python, MATLAB, or R)</li>
        <li>Experience with neuroimaging, computational modeling, and/or machine learning</li>
        <li>Publication record</li>
        <li>Strong communication skills</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h6>Location & Application</h6>
        <p>This is a 1-year, on-site position in the Department of Psychology at Virginia Tech (Blacksburg, VA), with the possibility of renewal.
          The start date is flexible, but please indicate your preferred start date in your application. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.
          If the position is filled, a notice will be posted here.</p>

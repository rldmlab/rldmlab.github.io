    I am interested in gaining a better understanding of how the brain develops a structural representation of the relationships between entities (e.g., objects, people, and abstract task states) or hidden task structures from our everyday experiences and how these representations enable behavioral flexibility. I obtained my Ph.D. in Culture Technology from KAIST and subsequently worked as a postdoctoral researcher at CNRS and UC Davis. As a charg√© de recherche (researcher) at the Institute of Cognitive Science in CNRS, my primary goal is to uncover the neural computational mechanisms that underlie learning, decision-making, and social interactions. <br>
